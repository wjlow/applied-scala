# Circe Exercises

Circe (pronounced SUR-see, or KEER-kee in classical Greek, or CHEER-chay in Ecclesiastical Latin) is a JSON library for Scala.

We like Circe as opposed to other libraries because it is functional, type-safe and very idiomatic.
It integrates very well with the Cats ecosystem.

There are 3 parts to these exercises. The recommended progression is:

1. Parsing (`String => Json`)
1. Decoding (`Json => A`)
1. Encoding (`A => Json`)
