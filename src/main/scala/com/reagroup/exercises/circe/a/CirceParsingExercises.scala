/**
  * Circe (pronounced SUR-see, or KEER-kee in classical Greek, or CHEER-chay in Ecclesiastical Latin) is a JSON library for Scala.
  *
  * We like Circe as opposed to other libraries because it is functional, type-safe and very idiomatic.
  * It integrates very well with the Cats ecosystem.
  *
  * For more comprehensive docs on Circe:
  * https://circe.github.io/circe/
  *
  * There are 3 parts to these exercises.
  *
  * 1. Parsing (`String => Json`)
  * 2. Encoding (`A => Json`)
  * 3. Decoding (`Json => A`)
